This game was orignially inspired by the song "Dumbest Girl Alive" by 100 Gecs, with the idea of making bad (funny) decisions while in a frenzy and not thinking clearly.

It didn't thematically work out so now it's a game about catching the last bus after work.
You also have a giant mallet to knock people out of the way. 100% non-lethal.
